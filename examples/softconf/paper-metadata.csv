108,Mitigating Data Sparsity for Short Text Topic Modeling by Topic-Semantic Contrastive Learning,"Xiaobao Wu, Anh Tuan Luu and Xinshuai Dong",Information Retrieval and Text Mining,Yiqun LiuWen-tau Yih,Accept-Poster,,"To overcome the data sparsity issue in short text topic modeling,
        existing methods commonly rely on data augmentation or the data characteristic of short texts
        to introduce more word co-occurrence information.
        However, most of them do not make full use of the augmented data or the data characteristic:
        they insufficiently learn the relations among samples in data,
        leading to dissimilar topic distributions of semantically similar text pairs.
        To better address data sparsity, in this paper
        we propose a novel short text topic modeling framework, Topic-Semantic Contrastive Topic Model (TSCTM).
        To sufficiently model the relations among samples,
