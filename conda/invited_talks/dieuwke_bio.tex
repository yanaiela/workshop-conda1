Dieuwke Hupkes is a research scientist at Meta. Among other things, she works on better understanding how (large) language models generalise, what they (don't) understand and what that even means, and more generally on how they can reasonably be evaluated. She is excited about the new opportunities such models bring us and the new scientific challenges that go hand in hand with that.
