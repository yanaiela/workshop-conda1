Just as we evaluate models, we should measure data. Measuring data involves quantifying different aspects of its composition, such as counts of the top-represented domains, or correlations between sensitive identity terms and other concepts. In this talk, I will define the problem of measuring data and unpack how it can be applied to automatically curating distinct training and evaluation datasets for ML models.
